# My take on some data science!
I find machine learning and data science in its entirety fascinating so I thought that
maybe I aswell could get a grasp of it just by doing! I gathered Jyväskyläs apartment pricing
from Etuovi.com. Plan is to make some kind of analysis of the pricing in Jyväskylä and maybe 
feed it to some machine learning model(?). 

[This site](http://kannattaakokauppa.fi/) got me pumped!

TODO:
- [ ] clean the data entirely
- [ ] form it to reasonable groups e.g. Areas of Jyväskylä?
- [ ] Some ML model ?
- [ ] Charts maybe ?
